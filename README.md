# Microprocessor_ARMCortexM4 

This repository stores the assignments of lab CSE-3113, Microprocessor and Assembly Language Lab. The assignments were based on ARM assembly language using the ARM Cortex-M4 microprocessor. It is a 32-bit ARMv7-M architecture-based microprocessor that is commonly used in microcontroller systems such as STM32F446RE.

P.S- All the details of each assignment is given in each file (e.g, problem given (_Instruction), documents, output of different registers in picture, assignment report).
